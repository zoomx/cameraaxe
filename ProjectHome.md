The Camera Axe is a tool for photographers to trigger cameras or flashes based signals from various sensors. The Camera Axe is useful for catching phenomena that happen too quickly for human reflexes, like photographing a popping balloon or a milk droplet splash. Other uses can be to catch things photographers don't want to wait around for like birds flying to a bird feeder or surveillance of people walking down a hallway. The possibilities are endless.
